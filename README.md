# landing-page

This project, which is a part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum, focuses on building a fully responsive landing page. 

The primary goal is to apply and solidify my understanding of HTML and CSS concepts, including semantic structure, Flexbox, and 
styling techniques.

Additionally, I intend to use this project as a foundation to creating a personal portfolio page that I can develop further for 
career growth. By the end of this project, I am to have a visually appealing and functional web page that demonstrates my skills 
and progress as an early web developer.
